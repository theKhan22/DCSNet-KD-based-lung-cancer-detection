# DCSNet-KD: Distilled Cross-Scale Network for Lung Cancer Detection

This repository contains the official implementation of **DCSNet-KD**, a knowledge distillation framework designed to improve lung cancer detection by leveraging a distilled cross-scale neural network.  

## 📖 Preprint
You can read the preprint here: [DCSNet-KD: Distilled Cross-Scale Network for Lung Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09334)

## 🔑 Key Features
- Knowledge Distillation applied to lung cancer detection.
- Cross-scale network architecture for robust performance.
- Comprehensive experiments with teacher and student models.
- Performance evaluation with multiple metrics.

## ▶️ Usage

### Training

Run training with knowledge distillation:

```bash
python training/train_kd.py --teacher resnet50 --student custom_student --epochs 100
```

### Evaluation

Evaluate a trained model:

```bash
python evaluation/evaluate.py --model custom_student --weights path/to/weights.pth
```

## 📊 Results

* Distillation improved the performance of lightweight student models.
* Custom student architecture achieved strong accuracy while remaining computationally efficient.
